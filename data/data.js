      ceodescription: "In a rapidly changing world, the importance of energy is growing day by day. Out of those the electric energy is the most important element of human’s life on the earth, we can’t imagine without electric energy for human’s life, but fossil fuels are depleting. The high cost of depletion of fossil fuels is an important issue of national competitiveness as well as an economic burden. Also, electric energy generated by fossil fuels generates a lot of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is constantly increasing, causing air pollution, environmental pollution, and global warming. With global warming constantly being raised due to atmospheric and environmental pollution, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that polar bear populations will decline by about 30% by 2050. Can't we live with polar bears anymore? It's difficult, but someone has to do it. ENPOSS is going to take a one step ahead to protect the environment of the earth with its technology because there is a beautiful day to be followed by tomorrow. For more than a decade, ENPOSS’s energy-saving device FORCE has entered the world and is recognized for its outstanding technology. Starting with the reduction of electrical energy, ENPOSS wants to improve the planet's environment and reduce the economic burden of using electric energy for all customers around the world.

      storydescription: "ENPOSS was born in 2005 to save energy and save the planet. Carbon Dioxide emissions cause greenhouse effect.This greenhouse gas traps the heat like a blanket and causes global warming. Enposs reduces consumption of electricity and thereby contributes to reduction in carbon dioxide emission.This in turn reduces global warming. (The way to slow global warming is to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, a green gas. ENPOSS has also worked on ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by reducing electric energy consumption.).ENPOSS took the initiative of developing FORCE, an electric energy saving device contributing towards environmental protection. FORCE is efficient and effective in saving electric energy. By reducing electric energy consumption we are pleased to be a part of the drive which reduces carbon dioxide emissions via our device FORCE. Today, ENPOSS has an international presence.It's global market includes the United States, China, Russia, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, and Brazil etc.With gadget called Force, ENPOSS is the force that is protecting the health and wealth of the earth.",
